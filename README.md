# Groundwork

## Status: WP 4, ACF 5

A WordPress starter kit, based on the excellent work of [Roots.io]. 

Rather than just use [bedrock], I have pieced this together from [@swalkinshaw]â€™s thorough [screencast], to increase the size of my brain.

Hopefully this may be useful to web developers who want a well organised, easy to deploy WordPress installation.

## Instructions

* `composer install`
* Create `.env` file from `.env.example`
* Make a nice new database
* Set environment variables in your new `.env` file
  1. Database name
  * Database user
  * Database password
  * Database host (eg `localhost`)
  * Environment definition (eg `development`)
  * Home URL (eg `http://growdigital.org`)
  * WordPress site URL (eg `http://growdigital.org/wp`)
  * Get your [Salts], add them to `.env`
* Set [WordPress file permissions]
* Run the WordPress install in a browser
* Change `Site address (URL)` in `Settings > General`
* Enable permalinks in `Settings > Permalinks`
